## What is Open AI API and the API key used for?

Open AI is the service behind ChatGPT. The mod uses the Open AI API and uses the same model that runs ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo).

You will need to create or have an account with OpenAI in order to use the mod.

Creating an API Key with Open AI allows the mod to use the API to generate just like ChatGPT but inside the Sims.

Your API key is a secret and is never sent to Sentient Sims and stays local to your computer.

## What is the Sentient Sims Companion App?

The Sentient Sims Companion App runs in the background to keep your interactions with the OpenAI API secure. It makes sure that the communication between the mod and the OpenAI API is protected. 

The developers of Sims 4 didn't include the necessary tools for secure requests, so the Sentient Sims Companion App is needed to make it work securely. In short, the app makes sure your requests to Open AI are safe and private.

Think of them as a special lock that keeps your information safe while it travels between the mod and the API.
